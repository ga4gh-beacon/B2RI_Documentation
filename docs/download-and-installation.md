# Summary

The Beacon v2 Reference Implementation is a software that must be installed **locally** in a Linux server/workstation.

The software consists of [several components](https://b2ri-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/beacon-v2-reference-implementation) that are distributed in two different GitHub repositories, one for [data ingestion tools](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools) and another for the [API](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-api). The software also needs external dependencies to work. In this regard, we provide several alternatives for download and installation.

!!! Note "Tip"
    The data ingestion tools can function without the API, so you can download one without the other.

Before starting, it will be necessary to install:

* [Mongoimport](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongoimport/)
* [Docker + Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

## Containerized (Recommended)

### Method 1: All containers in one

##### Setting up all the containers, beacon2-ri-tools and beacon2-ri-api together using the [beacon2-ri-api repository](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-api).

Clone beacon2-ri-api GitHub repository.

    git clone https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-api.git

From now on, the commands should be executed from the deploy directory.

    cd beacon2-ri-api/deploy

Light up all the containers.

    docker network create my-app-network
    docker-compose up -d --build

##### Deploying external tools in beacon2-ri-tools container

This step will inject the external tools and DBs into the image and modify the configuration files. It will also run a test to check that the installation was successful. Note that running `deploy_external_tools.sh` will take some time (and disk space!!!).

Go inside beacon2-ri-tools container.

    docker exec -it deploy_beacon-ri-tools_1 bash
    bash /usr/share/beacon-ri/beacon2-ri-tools/BEACON/bin/deploy_external_tools.sh

!!! Important
    The container's name should be similar to `deply_beacon-ri-tools_1`. It can be extracted from docker ps (`docker execâ€“it<container_name>bash`)

With `mongo-express` it is possible to see the contents of the data base at http://localhost:8081.

For more installation options, please follow the instructions provided in the [README](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-api/blob/master/deploy/README.md).

### Method 2: Independent containers

Download the beacon2-ri-tools container and the beacon2-ri-api container independently.

!!! Note "Tip"
    The data ingestion tools can function without the API, so you can download one without the other.

#### Data ingestion tools (beacon2-ri-tools)

Containerized options to install the [Data ingestion tools repository](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools).

##### Option 1: Build the container from Docker Hub

A set of Docker images can be obtained from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/beacon2ri/beacon_reference_implementation). Please see the documentation there. 

##### Option 2: Build the container from the Dockerfile in the GitHub repository

Download the `Dockerfile` from [Github](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools/blob/main/Dockerfile) by typing:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools/main/Dockerfile 

Then, execute the following commands to build the container (~1.1G):

    docker build -t crg/beacon2_ri:latest .

!!! Important
    Docker containers are fully isolated. If you think you'll have to mount a volume to the container, please read the section [Mounting Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) before proceeding further.

Then:

    docker run -tid --name beacon2-ri-tools crg/beacon2_ri:latest # run the image detached
    docker exec -ti beacon2-ri-tools bash # connect to the container interactively

#### Deploy external tools needed

This step will inject the external tools and DBs into the image and modify the [configuration](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools/blob/main/README.md#readme-md-setting-up-beacon) files. It will also run a test to check that the installation was succesful. Note that running `deploy_external_tools.sh` will take some time (and disk space!!!).

    bash beacon2-ri-tools/BEACON/bin/deploy_external_tools.sh

To see more information regarding the Data ingestion tools repository, please follow the instructions provided in the [README](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools/blob/main/README.md#containerized).

#### Beacon v2 REST API (beacon2-ri-api)

Containerized options to install the [Data ingestion tools repository](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools).

Clone beacon2-ri-api GitHub repository.

    git clone https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-api.git

All the commands should be executed from the deploy directory.

    cd deploy

Light up only the containers needed:

```bash 
docker network create my-app-network
docker-compose up -d --build training-ui db mongo-express beacon permissions idp idp-db
```

With `mongo-express` we can see the contents of the database at http://localhost:8081.

For more installation options, please follow the instructions provided in the [README](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-api/blob/master/deploy/README.md). 

Now you should have the two things downloaded, installed and set up: the beacon2-ri-tools and the beacon2-ri-api. Together (Method 1) or independently (Method 2) 

You can start transforming your data to BFF and loading it to the database following the [Data beaconization tutorial](https://b2ri-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial-data-beaconization/).

## Non containerized (data ingestion tools)

!!! Warning "Message"
    This alternative requires a few more steps than the containerized one, but it gives the deployer more control over the tools.

We will download the **data ingestion tools** from [this](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools) repository. Please follow the instructions provided in the [README](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon2-ri-tools#non-containerized).
 
The data ingestion tools need **external software** to function:

* **BCFtools** (version 1.15.1)
* **SnpEff** + databases (version 5.0)
* **MongoDB**

!!! Important
    Even if you have the **external tools** already in your system, for the sake of consistency of versions, we recommend downloading them from our servers.

We will download _BCFtools_, _SnpEff_ and _MongoDB_ utilities from a public `ftp` server (`ftp://xfer13.crg.eu`) located at CRG. We will use `wget` to get the five parts (~65G total). Each part should take around 20 min to download:

    wget ftp://FTPuser:FTPusersPassword@xfer13.crg.eu:221/beacon2_data.md5
    wget ftp://FTPuser:FTPusersPassword@xfer13.crg.eu:221/beacon2_data.part1
    wget ftp://FTPuser:FTPusersPassword@xfer13.crg.eu:221/beacon2_data.part2
    wget ftp://FTPuser:FTPusersPassword@xfer13.crg.eu:221/beacon2_data.part3
    wget ftp://FTPuser:FTPusersPassword@xfer13.crg.eu:221/beacon2_data.part4
    wget ftp://FTPuser:FTPusersPassword@xfer13.crg.eu:221/beacon2_data.part5

Once you have downloaded the 5 parts and the checksum file (\*.md5) please check that they are complete:

    md5sum beacon2_data.part? > my_beacon2_data.md5
    diff my_beacon2_data.md5 beacon2_data.md5

Now join the 5 parts by typing (note that momentarily we'll be using ~128G):

    cat beacon2_data.part? > beacon2_data.tar.gz 
    rm beacon2_data.part?

OK, everything ready to untar the file:

``` bash
tar -xvf beacon2_data.tar.gz
cd snpeff/v5.0 ; ln -s GRCh38.99 hg38 # In case the symbolic link does not exist already
```

*NB*: Feel free now to erase ```beacon2_data.tar.gz``` if needed.

Great! now we recommend moving the directories to your favourite location and keep the path. We will be using the paths to **set up** some variables for **SnpEff** and for **beacon** configuration files. 

!!! Warning "About `java`"
    SnpEff runs with `java` which you may need to install separately. See how [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-jre).


For **SnpEff**:

Use the path where you have left the databases and use it to change ```data.dir``` variable in ```snpEff.config``` file (located in SnpEff installation folder).
For instance, in my case:

```
#data.dir = ./data/

data.dir = /media/mrueda/4TB/Databases/snpeff/v5.0/
```

And finally....

For **Beacon**:

Open the file ```config.yaml``` (inside ```beacon_X.X.X``` dir installation) and change the paths to the files/exes according to your new locations. Note that `SnpSift` is part of `SnpEff` main distribution.

You can start transforming your data to BFF and loading it to the database following the [Data beaconization tutorial](https://b2ri-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial-data-beaconization/).

That's it!


### MongoDB installation

We're going to install it by using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose). You need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. `docker-compose` enables defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

!!! Danger "About Docker"
    It's out of the scope of this documentation to explain how to install `docker` engine and `docker-compose`.
    Please take a look to Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) if you need help with the installation.

First you need to create a file named ```docker-compose.yml``` with these contents:

```
version: '3.1'

# networks:
#   beacon-priv:
#   idp-priv:
#   pub:

services:

  ###########################################
  # MongoDB Database
  ###########################################

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    hostname: mongo
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    # networks:
    #   - beacon-priv

  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
    environment:
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: root
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: example
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL: mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/
    # networks:
    #   - beacon-priv
```

And then run:

    docker-compose up -d

Once complete you should have two Docker processes: ```mongo``` and ```mongo-express```. You can check this by typing:

    docker ps -a

!!! Warning "About MongoDB Community version"
    We're deliberately installing `mongodb` package provided by Ubuntu, which is **not** maintained by MongoDB Inc. The _official_ distribution of MongoDB Community is called `mongodb-org` and can be obtained [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu).

**Mongo Express** is an [open source](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express) lightweight web-based administrative interface deployed to manage MongoDB databases interactively. You can access `mongo-express` at `http://localhost:8081`.

!!! Important
    We will be installing **MongoDB** with a _single node/server_ configuration. Note that MongoDB allows for other topologies such as as _replica sets_ that we won't be covering in this documentation.
